To use the script just run the <b>solutionscript.py</b>

For each of the solutions you will need to use a path that leads to <b>emails</b> folder or to the <b>recruitment-task-backend-internship</b> folder in your PC

There are 4 functions in the <b>solution_lib.py<b/>. Each is responsible for each task.
